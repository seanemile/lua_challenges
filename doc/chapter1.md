# Chapter 1:
1. REPl demo
    - Print "Hello world"
    - Add two numbers
    - Write a program that given a number returns the factorial. 
    -  read a file while in lua REPL. 
    - What are the identifiers rules (3)
    - Write a multi-line long comment
    - Declare a global variable
    - Assign a 'nil' value to the global variable

# Types
1. REPl demo 
    - Use type() operator to display all types in lua(8).
    - Name falsy values in lua. 
    - Demo the use of logical operators(3).
    - Demonstrate us of ternary operation with logical operators. 
    - What is the boolean inverse of 'nil'.
    - Run the factorial example. What happens to your program if you enter a negative number?
Modify the example to avoid this problem.
    - Run the twice example, both by loading the file with the -l option and with dofile. Which way do you prefer?
    -  Can you name other languages that use "--" for comments?
    - Which of the following strings are valid identifiers? ___ _end End end until? nil NULL one-step
    -  What is the value of the expression type(nil) == nil? (You can use Lua to check your answer.) Can you explain this result? 
    - How can you check whether a value is a Boolean without using the function type?
    - Consider the following expression:
 (x and y and (not z)) or ((not y) and x)
Are the parentheses necessary? Would you recommend their use in that expression?
    - Write a simple script that prints its own name without knowing it in advance.
